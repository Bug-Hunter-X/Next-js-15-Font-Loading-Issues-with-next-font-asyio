# Next.js 15 Font Loading Issues
This repository demonstrates a common bug encountered when using `next/font` in Next.js 15, specifically related to font loading inconsistencies during dynamic imports or server-side rendering (SSR).  The bug manifests as fonts not loading correctly or flickering on initial page load.  A potential cause is the asynchronous nature of font loading and its interaction with the hydration process.

## Bug Reproduction
The `bug.js` file contains code exhibiting this issue. Running this code will likely result in the fonts failing to load correctly or displaying intermittent flickering.

## Solution
The solution involves employing strategies for optimizing the way fonts are loaded and handled, ensuring that they are correctly integrated into the page's rendering process. These techniques are explored in the `bugSolution.js` file.

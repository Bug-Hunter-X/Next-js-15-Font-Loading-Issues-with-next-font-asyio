In Next.js 15, the use of `next/font` for font optimization can sometimes lead to unexpected behavior, especially when dealing with dynamic imports or server-side rendering.  A common issue is that fonts might not load correctly or might flicker during the initial page load.  This is often due to the asynchronous nature of font loading and how it interacts with the hydration process.  Another subtle bug can occur with custom `@font-face` rules, where the font may not be applied correctly if the rule's path or syntax is slightly incorrect.
